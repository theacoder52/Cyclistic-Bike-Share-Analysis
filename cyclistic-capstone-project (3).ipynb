The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.**\\\n**Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.** **From these insights,our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.**\n\n### Characters and teams:\n\n-   **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes;about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n-   **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and the manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-07T20:00:21.545517Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-07T20:00:21.547274Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-07T20:00:21.669226Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.Ask\n\n*The questions that the stakeholders want answers of are:*\\\n**1.

So going with an conversion story right now is going to be risky.  \n\nSuppose there is a Casual user Clara she visited Chicago as a tourist and used our bike to commute to different parts of the city. Now since she doesn't live in Chicago why would she even buy our Annual pass. So to launch marketting campaigns that can convert Clara we need to know some more information about her such as Demographic information, her age, her gender.\n\n**There are two paths that I am going to recommend to stakeholders:**\n\n## 1. Reiterating  \n### 1.1 Changing The Business Objective   \n\nSince, the current data we have is not sufficient to answer the business objective. We can wait and tell the stakeholders about how the current data is not sufficient to answer the business objective. One way to move forward is changing the business objective.  \n\n### 1.2 Collecting more information about user demographic(While ensuring user privacy)  \nSample and collect more data about user demographics such as their locations, age, gender and their income.  \n\n## 2. Forging Ahead\nOne way to advance in this project is to move forward with whatever information we have.  \n\nMy top three recommendations for this path:  \n\nWith the current scenario launching a whole marketing campaign can cost us money and resources, but still we can make some changes with the insights we have.\n\n### 2.1 Introducing a weekend only pass.  \n\nCurrently we have only two kind of passes, **a daily or hourly pass** and **Annual Pass** there is a huge gap between our offerings. **If we can introduce something in between such as a** **Weekly pass** **that would be a win-win situation for both of us** since, we already know from our insights that casual riders nearly doubles in the weekends.\n\n### 2.2 Introducing a 6-month pass.  \n\n**Since, Casual riders mostly use our services in the summer season, introducing a six months pass would be the best way to attract the Casual riders into buying our passes.** \n\n### 2.3 Giving some special priviledges to Annual riders.  \n\nCurrently **Casual** and **Annual** riders enjoy the same freedom and services but **if we can give some special privilege to** **Annual** **riders such as making sure during peak hours** **Annual riders can book their bikes at a particular station from their app so that they don't have to worry about bike availability this can motivate regular casual users to buy our passes.** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Thanks for reading. \n**Do let me know if you have any feedback**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
